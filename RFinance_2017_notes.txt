## Machine learning paradigm

- At each point we compare many strategies over the lookback window, and switch to the best performing strategy.  
- One of the crucial meta-parameters is the length of the rolling lookback window.  
- But backtesting is a black box.
- Length of the rolling lookback window is a meta-parameter
- The length of the rolling lookback window is a meta-parameter, which determines how quickly the model adapts to new information.  
- In machine learning we can simulate the learning process using backtesting.  
- Backtesting allows simulating the learning process.

Let's start with a very simple analogy of coin flipping.
How Many Coin Flips are Needed to Decide Which Coin is Biased?

- How many years of performance data is needed to select a manager with skill?  

- What is the probability of selecting the skilled manager from among multiple managers?  

- What is the probability of correctly selecting a biased coin from a set of unbiased coins, after flipping the coins simultaneously $n$ times?  

- How much performance data is needed to select a manager with skill?  

- The challenge is that a manager without skill can have good performance, based on chance alone.

- If we Flip Many Coins Then We Will Always Find One That We Think is Biased

Let's apply this perspective to the problem of identifying active investment managers who can beat the market. Assume that for every such exceptional manager who can generate an excess return-to-risk ratio of 0.2 (after fees and against his benchmark), there are three other managers who have an expected Sharpe Ratio of 0. If anything, this may be optimistic given S&P Dow Jones reports only 1 in 10 active managers have been outperforming their benchmarks.5 How many 'flips' would you need to observe from all four managers, in parallel, to identify the good one with $95\%$ confidence? 

That's saying you would want to see 225 years of returns to be able to identify the good manager with $95\%$ confidence. You might be tempted to think, 'What if I observe the managers on a weekly basis, won't that give me 225 flips in about 4 Â½ years?' Unfortunately, that won't help, because when we observe the managers on a more frequent basis,

We have a set of unbiased coins, except for a single biased one, which has a probability of heads greater than 50% (say 60%).  

To find the biased coin, we flip the coins simultaneously $n$ times, and select the coin that produces the most heads.  

If several coins produce the same number of heads, then we select from them a coin randomly.

What is the probability of correctly selecting the biased coin, after flipping the coins simultaneously $n$ times?  

We're given an urn with unbiased coins, but one of the coins is biased (with a 60% probability of heads).  We want to find the biased coin, so we flip the coins simultaneously, and select the coin that produces the most heads.  

Plot probabilities of selecting the biased coin

We're only allowed to select a fixed number of coins at random, and then to flip them together a fixed number of times.
How many coins should we select at random, in order too maximize our chances of selecting the biased coin?

You also know that the probability of getting either a biased or an unbiased coin is 50-50.  

but you don't know if it's biased or not, so you flip it many times to see if it produces more heads than tails.  

# Calculate probabilities of selecting the biased coin, after first selecting a given number of coins from a bin of 20 coins
# plot(num_coins*prob_s/20, t="l")

# Calculate probability of selecting the biased coin, when there's a tie in number of heads
# prob_tie <- function(num_coins, pro_b)
#   sum(choose(num_coins-1, 1:(num_coins-1)) * pro_b^(1:(num_coins-1)) * (1-pro_b)^((num_coins-2):0) / (2:num_coins))
